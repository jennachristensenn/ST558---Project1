## Fetching Data from the Census API

The Census microdata API has a pretty straightforward endpoint. We make a GET request with URL parameters to specify which variables we select. We have a separate R script (/scripts/api_tools.r) that holds the entire functions. One of them fetches raw data, one converts raw data into a tibble, and one dispatches the process when a user provides years, numeric variables, and categorical variables as arguments. We check them and warn the user if their input is invalid.
